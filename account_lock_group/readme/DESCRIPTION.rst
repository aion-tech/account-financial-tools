Account lock dates can be updated without restrictions by the dedicated group "Update lock dates without restrictions".

If a user is in the group "Update lock dates without restrictions", they can update the account lock dates `period_lock_date`, `fiscalyear_lock_date` and `tax_lock_date` without raising any exception.

Updating such dates is usually restricted for a good reason, so update them at your own risk.
